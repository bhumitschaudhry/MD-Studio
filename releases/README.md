# Releases

This folder is for local release artifacts you choose to commit (if any).
Tauri builds Windows installers under `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
Copy the generated `.exe` and `.msi` here if you want them versioned or to verify local builds.

Latest local artifacts:
- `MD Studio_1.0.3_x64-setup.exe`
- `MD Studio_1.0.3_x64_en-US.msi`

GitHub Releases are published outside the repo; see README.md for links.
