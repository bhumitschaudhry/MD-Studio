# Releases

This folder is for local release artifacts you choose to commit (if any).
Tauri builds Windows installers under `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
Copy the generated `.exe` and `.msi` here if you want them versioned or to verify local builds.

GitHub Releases are published outside the repo; see README.md for links.
